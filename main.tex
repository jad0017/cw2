% Lots of shit happenining here.
% Probably based off of old poems.
% The shadow people (specifically the tall man)
% The watcher (basically death) overseeing everything
% When you think about dying and what comes next and your brain locks up.
% The locked up periods will start to be interlaced with the ugly story.
% First time should just be two pages of nothing (blank pages) before
% snapping back to reality.  Narrated first person account.
% Use personalities that you already know.
% Tell a bunch of stories from the past to start linking the paranormal events
% Use Robin (psychic) as a turning point going through the whole
%   Richmond Virginia thing (Thane district) and whatever else... the reading
%   Creativity (wands), Strength (VI), Lots of swords, the 7 of cups, the
%   queen of wands (spirit guide).
% Interlace the card reading with the stories.
% "Where as I am a storm cloud, you are the god rays peaking out of the
%   darkness."
% Should this be an extension of the "I Dreamt of Death" story?
% Should this include the Social Engineering parts of the story?
% I imagine painting the main character as one person then giving
%   glimpses of the completely different person of the past might be okay.
%   Also the Lindsey-esque character should probably still tell the main
%   character what she believes his life is like so that the main character
%   can paint a different picture from the grandiosity.
% Need to get less poetic and more colorful with descriptions.  The poetic
%   style of my writing is a bit jarring and misunderstood by most.
% If using "I Dreamt of Death" as a precursor to this story then there must
%   be tie-ins to the main character not removing her heart and instead just
%   severing her head.  Something like forgetting to remove the heart is what
%   cursed him and set off this weird set of events.  Granteded this story
%   could also come before those events as a lead into why the main character
%   is so insane.  Of course the third method is to simple pull inspiration
%   from it and go a completely different way which is most likely going
%   to be the case since the writing style will be so different that they will
%   be /very/ distinct pieces of work.
%
% Poems:
%   A Gales Embrace (night terror sort of thing)
%   Again [High Sodium Content] (the soy sauce)
%   Cadence [of Rotten Memory] (the mirrors -- always watch[er])
%   Demons (for the fear of death)
%   Island (the demon on the island that whispers all the time)
%   Phantasmagoria (the Tall Man / Shades)
%   Sam (the woods and the flamming ghost)
%   Savante [Schollarly Skies] (desert)
%   Sky [1-3] (the struggle man)
%   When Man Is Laid To Rest (the stump and the eyes)
%
% Come up with a plotline then write poems about each stage
%   use the poems as a basis for the work.
